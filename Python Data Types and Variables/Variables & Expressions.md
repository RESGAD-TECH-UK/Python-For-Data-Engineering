# Variables
This giant bookshelf of bytes in computer memory contains everything that the computerâ€™s brain (its CPU) needs in order to do computery things. But how do you keep track of everything?

A Python program has code (the instructions) and data (the values and their types). Like most computing languages, Python has the concept of a variable: a unique name inside the code that refers to a specific data value. It keeps track of exactly where the data is stored on these long memory bookshelves.


# Expressions

An expression is a line of code that can be reduced to a value.
